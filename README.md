PWM - Robot Motion


__*PRELAB*__

__Hardware setup__  
This Lab requires me to demonstrate movement forward, backward, a small (< 45 degree) turn left and right, and a large (> 45 degree) turn left and right. The robot should perform these movements sequentially, completely disconnected from a computer (no USB cord). Before I begin to set it up, I must think of a way to connect all of the pins and hardware to achieve robot control.  First, I will connect the pins as if I had the software already created and ready for upload.
